# Policy

TBD: Things to cover in the introduction:

  - Commercial use and re-use (wasn't in original outline, but should
    be represented in this section).

  - Importance of distinguishing between trademarks, copyrights, and
    patents.

## Copyright

TBD

Copyright is well-covered by open source licenses.  It is their main
concern, and most of the terms in the common open source licenses
concern copyright permissions.

It is likely that these open source licenses operate in standard ways,
across most countries.  Copyright law is somewhat standardized among
Berne Convention signatory countries, and most comentators treat open
source licenses as having the same effect regardless of jurisdiction.
At the same time, these licenses were written primarily with United
States law in mind, and few licenses have been the subject of
official, judicial interpretation.  The one exception is version 3 of
both the GNU General Public License and the Affero GNU General Public
License.  These were intentionally written to achieve the same result
in every country.  The GPL family of licenses have also been the
subject of litigation in multiple jurisdictions.


## Trademark

## Patent

## Commercial Use

## Security

TBD: Security policy comes from threat modeling, risk assessment, and
cost/benefit analysis.  In Security, distinguish what's discussed in
this section from what's discussed in the "Security" subsection in
Adoptability.

## Data Privacy

Data privacy is complex.  Privacy *from* whom *for* whom.  Note
connections to security; all the policy in the world doesn't help you
without technical security.  Note connection to vendor SLA (and to
liability).

### GDPR

TBD

## Aligning FOSS Policy With National/Legal Policy

TBD
