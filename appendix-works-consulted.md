# Appendix: Works Consulted

This list uses a modified form of [MLA](https://www.mla.org/) citation
guidelines.  We include only referenced blogs, journal articles, and
reports in works cited -- things from which we pulled direct insights.
As this toolkit is mainly meant for the Web, we use hyperlinks instead
of in-text citations.
