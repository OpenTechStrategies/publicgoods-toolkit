# Interview Questions

This document contains default interview questions.  It is meant to
stimulate conversation and suggest topics for discussion.  Our
interviews are not surveys, and there is no prescribed list of
questions.  It is unlikely any interview will cover all or even most
of these questions.

 * What types of DPGs does your Pathfinder Pilot encourage or create?
   * Can you describe the users for these DPGs?
   * What are the broad goals that you have for your Pathfinder Pilot?

 * Do you have an anticipated timeline for when you might update these?
   * Do you expect to replace these in the future?

Our role here is to make these DPGs more effective for you and more concrete in guidance.
* What types of challenges have you faced with your DPG rollout?
  * What would help reduce those challenges?
* What is the most successful aspect of your work in this DPG?
  * Is there anything that isn't contributing to that success? [revise, this is a 'what's missing' question]
* What have you learned about domestic capacity to create and work
  with DPGs?  How easy or difficult is it to find open collaborators
  to help build DPGs?

One sign of DPG success is collaboration and reuse.
 * To what extent are your DPGs created in collaboration that crosses team or agency boundaries?
 * Have you seen any reuse of your DPGs?
 * Which of your DPGs is most susceptible to reuse?


Pathfinders are good sources of information about how we can help them better.
 * What would you like to see in a toolkit?
