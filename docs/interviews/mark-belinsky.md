# Interview with Mark Belinsky and James Green 
UNDP Chief Digital Office / DPGA / Government Toolkit 


Role of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and its Chief Digital Office.
     Also your areas of responsibility.
     UNDP mission: "Eradicate poverty while protecting the planet."

     Mark founded Digital Democracy way back when.
     Went to Silicon Valley, launched and sold a startup there.

     UNDP Digital Office was built right before covid stuck.  The team
     has been growing fast for the past couple of years -- from 6 when
     Mark joined to a bit over 20 now.  Gaining traction within UNDP.

       - thought leadership
       - digital transformation w/in UNDP itself
       - facilitating digital transformation w/ partners around

     Mark works on innovation and scaling for that third, external
     facing piece.

     UNDP makes products and offerings to help them.  Tries hard to
     understand what's happening in the field; bottom-up approach to
     DPGs.  Adding layers of best practice, insight and support to
     what's happening.

     Org is pretty decentralized, though Mark is in NY office.

     Mark is one of the only technical ppl on the digital side, says
     technical capacity w/in the organization is not equiv to a tech
     startup of course (quite normal for many gov and NGOs).

     Right now are in the process of trying to be aware of

     "Inclusive digital transformation" but trying not being overly
     prescriptive -- e.g., no "technologies have to be open source".

     We are adherents/signatories "DIAL Digital Principles".
**** "Inclusive Digital Transformation"
     Working on nailing down exactly what that means; will
     "...having no citizens left behind."
**** Best examples of DPG success you're aware of?
     Ideally includes: real-world usage, locally sourced support, reuse.

     Don't know if we have that yet.

     No central database of landscape of digital projects.
     DO started using ML/AI to categorize projects

     longevity, local support, a lot of these pieces are unknown b/c
     they haven't been categorized yet.
**** Examples of DPG failure?
     Trying to identify the failure modes.

     *IMPORTANT*: A lot of technologies that are built and abandoned
     generally have very strong project design before the
     technologists come in, and then there is some forceful pushback
     if they are encouraged by the technologists to redesign.

     How do we create these DPGs in partnership w/ offices so we are
     establishing best principles from the beginning: MVP, iterative
     design, making sure what we're creating is actually needed,
     testing all hypotheses.

     Often there are questions around OSS: is it secure, what is the
     business model, etc.  W/ external technologists there may be a
     relationship not necessarily correlated with expertise; if DO is
     going against what hired local technologist says, the project
     owner has to throw up their hands and says I don't know who to
     trust but I have a relationship with this local person, so...

     *IMPORTANT*: Mark requests: a flowchart for decision-making!
     E.g., UNICEF provided a really good one for blockchain projects
     (leading usually to don't use blockchain of course).  Mark will
     send it.

     atrium.network/guide (see p. 9 / PDF p 12)

     The decisions for this flowchart would be: "Should you use OSS?
     Should this a DPG?"
**** Who asks UNDP DO for help, and if so, what do they ask for?
     Runs the gamut.

     In the 200 countries UNDP operates in, their operatives will send
     requests, e.g., about something that has been requested by the
     local government.

     Can we implement a Digital Readiness Assessment as a starting
     point?  Too often it's ppl asking for a faster horse.

     The Digital Readiness Assessment is almost ready -- intent is for
     it to be a DPG itself, of course!

     Right now it's being converted to a kobo toolkit survey (good,
     OSS), but then is analyzed in PowerBI.

     *IMPORTANT*: Ask Mark about this later.
**** Staff turnover at relevant agencies in Pathfinder countries?
     Lack the cohesive knowledge (of where projects are) to say one
     way or the other.
**** Digital sovereignty
     In many countries, "proprietary" also by definition means
     "foreign".  Is this an issue that drives decisions?
     Separate out data-storage sovereignty from running-code
     sovereignty.

     *IMPORTANT*: Mark's experience w/ digital sovereignty is that
     sovereignty is a more understood concept than digital, so
     perceptions about s are projected onto d in ways that are not
     necessarily fair or valid.  E.g., data has to stay in our country
     on our servers, but those servers are totally insecure and easily
     hacked.

     Local mgmt and therefore sovereignty of encrypted data in cloud
     storage is potentially a stronger real s than location-based s,
     but there's no opportunity to discuss that point.  Even country
     offices of UNDP aren't ready to.

     DIAL principles: security is just one piece, don't prioritize it
     above all else.
**** What would you like to see in
***** *IMPORTANT*: Use countries from the Global South as examples.
      Avoid giving the impression of digital imperialism.  (When Obama
      was in the White House, the U.S. was an okay example, but not
      anymore.  And not UK, Australia, etc either.)

      Mark may have some examples for us this soon; he's tuning their
      ML to try to identify them.
****** <2021-08-20 Fri> Karl to ask Mark about progress on this. [ref:ff1bfdf0] :KARL:DUE:
***** Map DPGs to UNDP DO's DTF categories if we can.
      UNDP DO has a Digital Transformation Framework they've developed
      (the Digital Readiness Assessment is structure on top of that).

      https://digital.undp.org/content/digital/en/home/work/transformation.html

      See detailed diagram in [[file:archive/Digital Transformation Framework Full.png][Digital Transformation Framework (full image)]],
      which Mark shared from [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/3cwyfs4uepody56/Digital%20Transformation%20Framework%20Full.png?dl=0][this Dropbox link]].  Would be great to
      have a mapping of DPGs to the DTF pillar elements and Sectoral
      Opportunities, b/c this would help UNDP fill in the gaps.
**** Language barriers.
     Mark feels digital literacy is bigger barrier than language
     barrier per se.

     Same way definitions of "broadband" are terribly outdated,
     definitions of DL are terribly outdated too.

     Q: What is your definition of DL?

     A: Comfort working in a virtual environment.  Comfort utilizing
        digital tools (say, Dropbox and SharePoint -- virtual
        whiteboard, virtual filing cabinet, virtual war room).  How
        deeply can you use tools (e.g., Excel formulas).  And perhaps
        project management: collaborative/team management tools like
        Asana etc.  And personal tool management: ppl who are literate
        have lots of tips and tricks -- to have a tip is a sign of DL
        that Mark would like to see in everyone.

     Digression about mute buttons.  UNDP is a Microsoft house, so
     often dealing with Teams.  Had been using Miro.

     Q: So why is UNDP a Microsoft shop?

     A: Mark evaluates Microsoft tools in comparison to the many other
        things he's used, but for many people Microsoft tools have
        been all they've used -- so its problems are their norm,
        that's what they think technology just inherently is like.

        Also, DO is also tech office, and decisions about org-wide
        tech usage come from the CTO not the CDO.  So there's this
        dance that DO does around what it recommends vs what it does.
        CTO's focus is entirely internally-facing of course.  So when
        DO is building externally-facing technologies, do they use the
        internal back-end?  It's always a complicated question.
        Result can often be that something is done "off book" in order
        to just Get It Done w/o waiting a month for approval from the
        technology office.

        Note that this is a situation that many DPG-using /
        DPG-producing agenies may also be in sometimes.
**** James's notes from this interview.  [ref:ed31d635]
     (James had to leave the interview partway through.  Karl found
     his notes in 'belinsky-notes.txt' and moved them here in r18353.)

     What's your role in all this Pathfinder stuff?
     Mark:  you lost me with "Pathfinder"
     
     James and I know each other from the tech for good space.  Helping to guide
     efforts of governments to pull in and explore FOSS.  This office at UNDP arose
     right before covid struck.  We went from 6 when I joined to a bit over 20 now.
     
     Their remit:
     
     * Thought leadership
     * Digital transformation of UNDP
     * Digital transformation of partners around the world
     
     Mark works on innovation and scaling.  We're a remote office, mostly not based in
     NY.  Many of us have never been to the office.
     
     They adhere to the DIAL digital principals, which helps keep them on an open
     source path. https://digitalprinciples.org/
     
     As a development agency, we see our value-add as "inclusivity", which means "no
     citizens left behind".  No tech for tech's sake
     
     Signs of DPG success?  We don't have that yet.  What is the landscape of digital
     projects?  We don't have a way to track or note that in our systems.  We started
     doing ML on proposals to detect that a proejct is open or not.  So now we have a
     list of digital projects.  We're seeking info on DPG success:  longevity, local
     support.  They're unknown because they're not part of the original proposal in
     legacy projects.  In other cases, we're just not at that point in the process of
     collecting it yet.
     
     Are there DPGs that haven't worked out?  There are a lot of projects that get
     designed before tech people get involved.  Then there's pushback when the techs
     ask for re-design.  How do we get tech involved earlier?  Establish best
     principles from the beginning (mvp, iterative design, requirements gathering,
     testing, reuse of existing projects).  Often there are questions around open
     source-- is it secure, what's the business model?  With external techs, there
     will often be relationships, and it's hard for the Digital Office to correct
     anything because external techs are closer to the project and have the
     relationship.  And then they'll find that the external tech isn't doing best
     practices (e.g. the code is on a laptop, not in an online repo).  And
     procurement processes make it hard to replace that person.
     
     Mark wants a flowchart for decision-making.  UNICEF provided a great one for
     blockchain projects (pg 9 of https://atrium.network/guide).  Guide should
     address: Should this be a DPG?  How do you make the decision of what tech to
     utilize?
