# Appendix: Resources and Tools

Additional resources and tools are listed by topical module. 

TBD: Question from Karl for Susy: I'd like to better understand the
purpose of this appendix and how it relates to the other appendices.
Well, as per our discussion on 2021-10-13, we're maybe going to create
some more topic-specific appendixes, so some of this will get moved to
one of those then.

(TBD: Write introductory paragraphs.  Add a few resources for
networking if possible.

* OECD policy-focused AI Policy Observatory -- https://www.oecd.ai/
* Open Data Handbook from the Open Knowledge Foundation --  https://opendatahandbook.org/
* Europe lists some, many useful globally too -- https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/about
* Africa regions
* South America
* India

Maybe think about this from a topic viewpoint, e.g., open source, open
data, AI.)

The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/community) is a good resource and hosts several mailing lists. 

You might also start by connecting with your local university,
especially if there's a computer science or data science program. Open
source and open data are also heavily relied upon in other
disciplines, like physics and public policy programs and business
schools. [DHIS2's early focus on building academic and regional
networks](
https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/the-transformative-role-of-academia-digital-public-goods/)
is a great example here. Academic institutions are another source of
useflu national and international networks. You're also likely to find
talent and support at any sort of commercial start-up accelerator or
incubator, which if not physically local might still be accessible and
helpful to you online.

## Benefits of Open Source

* The World Bank report [Open Source for Global Public
  Goods](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/33401)
  (2019) provides an overview of the benefits of open source along
  with sensible operational advice, especially for
  resource-constrained environments, and a few case studies of
  Identification for Development (ID4D)  esp in resource-constrained
  environments. More on It reiterates many of the same points we note
  here, such the benefits of open APIs and a modular architecture.

* [Open Source Software Finds its Sweet Spot in the Public
  Sector](https://www.publicsectorexecutive.com/Public-sector-focus/open-source-software-finds-its-sweet-spot-in-the-public-sector-)

General How-To Guides with Emphasis on Creating and Managing Your Own Open Source or Open Data Project 

* The [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net),
  listed as a DPG itself, "gives public organizations a model for
  building their own open source solutions to enable successful future
  reuse by similar public organizations in other places. It includes
  guidance for policy makers, city administrators, developers and
  vendors."

* [Federal Source Code
  Toolkit](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-open-source-toolkit): This
  is a government-wide project facilitated by the Code.gov team to
  produce "how to" documentation pertaining to federal source code and
  open source software (OSS). It provides guidance to agencies for
  creating and maintaining federal source code inventories and open
  source repositories.

* RedHat's [Guidebook for open source community management: The Open
  Source Way
  2.0](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/guidebook-open-source-community-management-open-source-way-20). The
  Mozilla Foundation also created an [Open Leadership Training
  Series](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/)
  that includes some useful tips on building contributor communities.

* Unfortunately, participants in online communities exhibit the same
  destructive behavior we see in the real world, and marginalized,
  vulnerable community members are most frequently targeted. Clear
  community participation guidelines can help fend off some of these
  behaviors, and their *enforcement* builds trust within a
  community. [Mozilla's Community Participation Guideline (CPG)](
  https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/)
  is a great model to consider copying for your own open source
  project. Mozilla's CPG is based on existing best practices and a
  good amount of hands-on experience and research into creating more
  inclusive contributor communities. Note that it includes a clear
  structure for reporting problematic community behavior and what to
  expect as part of this process. The DPG OpenMRS has a good [code of
  conduct](
  https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/RES/OpenMRS+Code+of+Conduct) that
  they adapted from the Ubuntu open source project. [Mozilla's 2020
  analysis of its contributor
  communities](https://report.mozilla.community/assets/report/Mozilla-Rebel-Alliance-Report-2020.pdf)
  provides more insight into how to support diversity and inclusion.

* https://producingoss.com/en/index.html

* https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/

* Crowdsourcing data collection -- particularly through volunteers --
  can also require attention to community development and management
  (e.g. [Lacuna Fund's RFP requirements
  here](https://s31207.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/09/RFP-Language_23-Sept-1.pdf)). 

* The open source and open data project Common Voice [published a
  ['community
  playbook'](https://common-voice.github.io/community-playbook/)to
  foster new, independent communities to form around collecting voice
  data different languages. This guidance helps Mozilla track data
  collection around the globe and ensure high quality while letting
  local efforts grow without much centralized control.

However, don't be put off by the more thorough guides we cite above
and feel encouraging and managing an open source project requires
significant investment in community development and governance. Deep
investment isn't necessary for every project type. For those where it
makes sense, you should approach community development in phases and
'right size' investment to what's needed. For example, the DPG [AI
Agro's machine learning
algorithms](https://github.com/RentadroneCL/AI-Agro) are available on
GitHub, with a simple overview of their project on that makes it clear
what they plan to work on, how to contribute, and how to join the
community discussion on Discourse. If we had to peg this as an
archetype, it's probably most akin to a Speciality Library. They're
open to anyone participating, but they're likely to only attract those
who have the skills and expertise to contribute and don't need to
build for a broader audience. The DPG Primero created a [global
inter-agency governance
structure](https://www.unicef.org/evaluation/media/946/file/Primero.pdf)
only when the platform had matured enough to merit such formalized
oversight.

For those projects that would benefit from a community manager, note
that a community manager's role can be more broadly defined to include
adjacent work like documentation, running trainings, and managing key
partners, as well as typical community management tasks like . For an
example, see a [recent job posting for a community
managaer](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/join-our-team/project-community-engagement-coordinator.html)
from the the team behind the Kobo Toolbox DPG (accessed Sept. 2021).

Creating your own community

There's a rich set of online materials about how to create and nurture
a thriving open source community. Some of our favorites include:

* The EU's [Guidelines for Sustainable Open Source Communities in the
  Public
  Sector](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Guidelines%20for%20Sustainable%20OSS%20Communities%20in%20the%20Public%20Sector%20final.pdf)
  (2020). This aligns with the recommendations covered here, from a
  needs and readiness assessment through long term sustainability, but
  it also includes a lits of key considerations to building your own
  open source community.

* The TODO Group's [Starting an Open Source
  Project](https://todogroup.org/guides/starting/) and [Building an
  Inclusive Open Source
  Community](https://todogroup.org/guides/diversity-inclusion/)

* https://opensource.guide/building-community/

* https://www.contributor-covenant.org/

* The OpenSRP project publishes a very readable, straightforward
  [overview of how its governance, contribution process and community
  management work](https://smartregister.org/governance-structure/). 

* [Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free
  Software Project](https://producingoss.com/en/index.html)

* Regarding external financing of projects, the [Guidelines for
  Funding Open Source Software
  Development](https://www.archesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/guidelines_funding_OSS.pdf])
  was written with an audience of public and private foundations in
  mind and will give you a good sense of what many funders are likely
  to look for in a proposal that includes open source software
  development. Many of the points in these guidelines also show up in
  practical recommendations in this paper, but you might still benefit
  from glancing at this as you plan for your DPG.

* Code of conduct - https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/RES/OpenMRS+Code+of+Conduct

## Resources and Tools Appendix: Policy

**Integrated Policy Approaches**

The World Bank pubished a background paper [Estonian e-Government
Ecosystem: Foundation, Applications,
Outcomes](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/165711456838073531-0050022016/original/WDR16BPEstonianeGovecosystemVassil.pdf)
that's a thorough overview of the integrated factors -- policies,
institutions, technologies and more -- that helped Estonia create a
successful e-government service ecosystem.

**Public Domain**

The Open Source Initiative provides a simple explanation of the
[problems of public domain
software](https://opensource.org/faq#public-domain)

**Security**

We like David Wheeler's much noted [essay on security in open source
versus closed
source](https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/open-source-security.html).
Bruce Schneier, a renouned security expert, has also [written
frequently on the
topic](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/12/open-source-does-not-equal-secure.html).

The Open Source Security Foundation publishes[free EdX
courses](https://openssf.org/edx-courses) on best practices in
developing secure software and hosts a [related open
community](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developer). The
paper [Threats, Risks, and Mitigations in the Open Source
Ecosystem](https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats/blob/main/publications/threats-risks-mitigations/v1.1/Threats%2C%20Risks%2C%20and%20Mitigations%20in%20the%20Open%20Source%20Ecosystem%20-%20v1.1.pdf)
has a great overview of how to think about security from the
perspective of an open source ecosystem (here, they use ecosystem to
describe the set of things that comprise a specific open source
project, such as developers, end users, technical architecture, and
package libraries).

Similar to the Principles for Digital Development on Privacy and
Security](https://digitalprinciples.org/principle/address-privacy-security/),
the Open Reference Architecture for Security and Privacy lists its own
set of [key
principles](https://security-and-privacy-reference-architecture.readthedocs.io/en/latest/08-security-principles.html)
along with a list of FOSS security and privacy
applications.(https://security-and-privacy-reference-architecture.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-sbbs.html)

A few **security questionnaires** we've come across that you might find useful as you evaluate working with vendors include: 

- [This security
  questionnaire](https://www.nj.gov/labor/assets/PDFs/rfq/SoNJ%20Third-Party%20Information%20Security%20Questionnaire%20v1.0.pdf)
  is from the state of New Jersey in the United States. It's extremely
  comprehensive and does reference local and national laws in the
  United States, yet it's still a useful model.

- [Google publishes several security
  questionnaires](https://vsaq-demo.withgoogle.com) that are also
  supported by an adaptable [interactive questionnaire
  application](https://github.com/google/vsaq)

* The United States National Institute for Standards and Techology
  (NIST) publishes a [security testing technical
  guide](https://www.nist.gov/publications/technical-guide-information-security-testing-and-assessment)
  that gives an "overview of key elements of technical security
  testing and examination, with an emphasis on specific technical
  techniques, the benefits and limitations of each, and
  recommendations for their use."

* The [SAFETAG](https://safetag.org) is a security auditing framework
  and evaluation template aimed at advocacy groups that might be more
  'right sized' for capacity limited DPGs.

Lastly, some thoughts on **cultural and security considerations when coding in the open**. 

It's important to think through the cultural shifts required for an
open project to succeed. Regulation, policies and processes can set
the boundaries of an environment and influence behaviour, but the
execution is still up to individual human choice.

Open source co-development often requires new tools and processes, and
that change must be supported by the organization's culture. At its
heart, open source collaboration requires communicating and coding in
the open. This transparency brings the benefits outlined throughout
this document, but it also opens the project -- and its human
participants -- to feeling vulnerable to more criticism and being
called out more easily for mistakes. Recognize that change feels like
a loss to many. It feels like a loss of stability and what they knew
about how to work, and they will need leadership and guidance. Be sure
to keep conversations going in your team about how well organizational
culture supports their needs.

One of the greatest fears of many developers is to jeopardize a
project's security and potentially harm real people. Many might worry
that open source code is itself a security vulnerability. What if a
mistake is made in the open? How can an agency decide what code should
stay proprietary because of security concerns?

The UK government has publicly wrangled with these issues and come up
with useful guidance. It's notable that their stance on how much code
to develop through an open source model has changed from "most" to
"all, with very limited exceptions."  In short, their experience taught
them that open sourcing code was actually a great way to confirm and
enhance security, perhaps even particularly for code related to
managing security. When following and enforcing [strong security
design](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cyber-security-design-principles),
such as ensuring configuration files are kept separately from code,
they found that open peer review improves security. 

The UK's guidance [Security Considerations When Coding in the
Open](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/security-considerations-when-coding-in-the-open)
is a concise, clear checklist for developers and program managers that
links to other useful resources, such as how to manage software
dependencies and the value of automated style enforcement. These
checklist items include:

* Open the code early
* Don't rely on closed code as your only security measure
* Follow good development practices
* Keep keys and credentials closed
* Assume accidental publications are compromised
* Deal with security vulnerabilities

Their [approach to when code should be kept
closed](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed)
is similarly straightforward:

* Data and code related to keys and credentials
* Algorithms used to detect fraud
* Unreleased policy should be kept closed.


## Resources and Tools Appendix: Adoptability

The [Open Source Maturity
Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSource_Maturity_Model) is
another way of evaluating an open source product for adoption. It
covers the same points we review in the paper, but it has more of a
process-oriented approach that also includes scoring and
weighting. More background is in this article by Bernard Golden in
[Technology Innovation Management
Review](https://timreview.ca/article/145), (May 2008).


## Resources and Tools Appendix: Procurement

The Digital Impact Alliance's [Procurement Of Digital
Technology](https://procurement-digitalimpactalliance.org/) is a
useful guide for budget planning. [TODO: describe a bit better w/
context] [NEW TODO: To delete b/c it's now incorporated into main text
appropriately]

This [panel discussion about agile development and modular
contracts](https://www.agilegovleaders.org/watch-agl-live-wild-wild-west-managing-agile-contracts-in-government/)
includes public sector employees from the state of California and 18F,
discussing great insights about the challenges and lessons learned in
their revamp of California's Child Welfare digital system.

(TBD: [ref:f9f71f8d]: Let's break out this long procurement-language
example into a separate appendix.  That thought might apply to other
sections in this appendix, too, but it applies most strongly here I
think.  -Karl)

Useful sample contract language

(TODO: Do we have better on hand?  We are asking for permssion to use
the following, but it's still US-centric.
https://www.eckertseamans.com/app/uploads/Steve-Foxman_Eckert-Seamans_DATA-PROTECTION-CLAUSES-101016-M1566466xA35AF.pdf)

Disclaimer: The following clauses are examples of actual data protection clauses used in technology agreements, adapted to remove any identifying information regarding the providers or customers. Use and final language of the following clauses must be modified to be appropriate for any specific software or service being provided by a licensor, vendor or service provider. Such clauses should not be used without advice from a lawyer familiar with technology agreements and data protection issues. Close attention must also be paid to any disclaimer or limitation of liability clauses, which may undermine the effectiveness of remedies related to any breach by any licensor, vendor or service provider of its contractual obligations.

Short and Concise Data Protection Clause:
Data Protection. Licensor acknowledges that it may have access to certain of Licensee’s computer and communications systems and networks for the purposes set forth in this Agreement. If any data is made available or accessible to Licensor, its employees, agents or contractors, pertaining to Licensee’s business or financial affairs, or to Licensee’s projects, transactions, clients or customers, Licensor will not store, copy, analyze, monitor or otherwise use that data except for the purposes set forth in the License Agreement for the benefit of Licensee. Licensor will comply fully with all applicable laws, regulations, and government orders relating to personally identifiable information (“PII”) and data privacy with respect to any such data that Licensor receives or has access to under the License Agreement or in connection with the performance of any services for Licensee. Licensor will otherwise protect PII and will not use, disclose, or transfer across borders such PII except as necessary to perform under the License Agreement or as authorized by the data subject or in accordance with applicable law. To the extent that Licensor receives PII related to the performance of the License Agreement, Licensor will protect the privacy and legal rights of Licensee’s personnel, clients, customers and contractors.
__________________________________________
Comprehensive Data Protection Clauses (Including Exhibit Language):
Customer Data and Intellectual Property. All right, title, and interest in Customer Data (as defined below) will remain the property of Customer. Licensor has no intellectual property rights or other claim to Customer Data that is hosted, stored, or transferred to and from the Products or the cloud services platform provided by Licensor, or to Customer’s Confidential Information. Licensor will cooperate with Customer to protect Customer’s intellectual property rights and Customer Data. Licensor will promptly notify Customer if Licensor becomes aware of any potential infringement of those rights in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
Security and Data Protection.

1. Customer Data and Security. All Customer Data that will be hosted by Licensor under this Agreement will be hosted at data centers maintained and operated by [insert name] located in [insert location address or addresses] (the “ Data Centers” ). For purposes of this Agreement and the Exhibits attached hereto “Customer
    
 Data” shall include any Customer Confidential Information, and any personally identifiable information relating to any customers, end users or employees of Customer, its suppliers or contractors (“ Personal Data”), to which Licensor has or may have access in connection with the operation or administration of Licensor’s platform, or in connection with the performance of Professional Services by Licensor for Customer under this Agreement or any applicable Statement(s) of Work. All Customer Data stored or at rest in the Data Centers, or in transport, will be encrypted in transport and will not be transferred to any other hosting entity or location without the prior written consent of Customer.

Licensor will provide the following available services and functions as part of the Software without additional cost: (i) the use of encryption technology to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access; and (ii) routine back‐up and archiving of Customer Data. Licensor will comply with the requirements of Exhibit __ (Data Security) and implement the Data Safeguards set forth in this Section, and Licensor will further implement reasonable security standards that it determines are necessary, but in no event less than industry standards, to protect (i) the physical security of the Data Centers used to maintain Customer Data; and (ii) Licensor’s network, all operating systems and software applications, and all data storage systems and media provided by Licensor or its licensors or contractors, or operated or provided by Customer that connect or interface with Licensor’s Products, Software or platform, from being subject to any Disabling Devices (as defined in Exhibit __ (Data Security) attached to this Agreement).

2. Data Safeguards. Licensor has represented to Customer that Licensor will not be permitted to access Customer Data stored or contained in the Products or Licensor’s platform, and Licensor will have no ability to manipulate, modify or control such Customer Data. If any support services or Professional Services provided by Licensor may involve Licensor or its personnel having or requiring access to Customer servers, Customer applications, and/or Customer Data, Licensor shall comply with the provisions of this Section and Exhibit __ (Data Security) attached hereto, and, at Customer’s request, Licensor shall enter into an appropriate separate agreement with Customer to govern such access and protect any Customer Data that may be subject to such access. To the extent Customer grants Licensor access to Customer Data, or Licensor has access to or stores or holds any Customer Data, Licensor agrees to:
(i) access and use the Customer Data solely for the purpose of providing Customer with access to the Products, Software and Licensor’s platform, and to provide Professional Services to Customer in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any applicable Statement(s) of Work;
(ii) maintain physical, technical, and administrative safeguards (including but not limited to those set forth in this Section, Exhibit __ (Data Security) attached to this Agreement, and in any event no less than industry standards in the cloud computing/online services industry) to protect the Customer Data against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure while it is accessible to or held by Licensor (“ Data Safeguards” ); and
(iii) not disclose the Customer Data to any third party, except: (x) to its employees, consultants or contractors who need to have access to such information and solely for purposes of providing Professional Services to Customer, provided that such recipients are bound by confidentiality provisions no less restrictive than those set out in this Agreement; and (y) to the extent required by a judicial order or other legal obligation, provided that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Licensor will promptly notify Customer of such a required disclosure to allow intervention by Customer (and will cooperate with Customer) to contest or minimize the scope of the disclosure.

 [NOT APPLICABLE OUTSIDE US] 3. SOC 1/SSAE 16 Certification. Licensor will, on at least an annual basis, hire a third party auditing firm to perform a Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 audit, or equivalent audit, on internal and external Licensor procedures and systems that access or contain Customer Data. Licensor shall adhere to SOC 1/SSAE 16 audit compliance criteria and data security procedures (or any successor report of a similar nature that is generally accepted in the industry and utilized by Licensor), applicable to Licensor.
Licensor’s security procedures will materially conform to the description thereof set forth in this Agreement and in attached Exhibit __ (Data Security), and as further described in Licensor’s most recently completed SOC 1/SSAE 16 audit report (or any successor report of a similar nature that is generally accepted in the industry and utilized by Licensor). Upon Customer’s request, Licensor will provide Customer with a copy of the audit results set forth in Licensor’s SOC 1/SSAE 16 audit report.

4. Data Breach. Licensor further agrees that it will monitor and test its Data Safeguards from time to time, and further agrees to adjust its Data Safeguards from time to time in light of relevant circumstances or the results of any relevant testing or monitoring. If Licensor suspects or becomes aware of any unauthorized access to any Customer Data or Personal Data by any unauthorized person or third party, or becomes aware of any other security breach relating to Personal Data held or stored by Licensor under this Agreement or in connection with the performance of the Professional Services or other services performed under this Agreement or any Statement(s) of Work (“Data Breach”), Licensor shall immediately notify Customer in writing and shall fully cooperate with Customer at Licensor’s expense to prevent or stop such Data Breach. In the event of such Data Breach, Licensor shall fully and immediately comply with applicable laws, and shall take the appropriate steps to remedy such Data Breach. Licensor will defend, indemnify and hold Customer, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, liability, loss, costs and damages, including reasonable attorney fees, arising out of or relating to any third party claim arising from breach by Licensor of its obligations contained in this Section, except to the extent resulting from the acts or omissions of Customer. All Personal Data to which Licensor has access under this Agreement, as between Licensor and Customer, will remain the property of Customer. Customer hereby consents to the use, processing and/or disclosure of Personal Data only for the purposes described herein and to the extent such use or processing is necessary for Licensor to carry out its duties and responsibilities under this Agreement, any applicable Statement(s) of Work, or as required by law. Licensor will not transfer Personal Data to third parties other than through its underlying network provider to perform its obligations under this Agreement. All Personal Data delivered to Licensor shall be stored in the United States or other jurisdictions approved by Customer in writing and shall not be transferred to any other countries or jurisdictions without the prior written consent of Customer.

Date Security Exhibit:
EXHIBIT __ Data Security

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Master Services and License Agreement to which this Exhibit is attached (“Agreement” ), and all other Exhibits thereto, and in addition to and not in lieu of other provisions in the Agreement and the Exhibits thereto, Licensor agrees as follows:
1. General Security Procedures
1.1 Without limiting Licensor’s obligation of confidentiality as further described in the Agreement and herein, Licensor will be responsible for establishing and maintaining an information security program that is designed to: (i) ensure the security and confidentiality of Customer Data; (ii) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the Customer Data; (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or use of the Customer Data; (iv) ensure the proper disposal of Customer Data, as further defined herein; and (v) ensure that all subcontractors of Licensor, if any, comply with all of the foregoing. Licensor will designate an individual to be responsible for the information security program. Such individual will respond to Customer inquiries regarding computer security and to be responsible for notifying Customer‐designated contact(s) if a breach or an incident occurs, as further described herein. The information security program will be audited annually as detailed in Licensor’s SSAE 16 and/or SOC 1 audit reports, which will be made available to Customer upon request.

1.2 Licensor must conduct formal security awareness training, with a testing component, for all personnel and contractors as soon as reasonably practicable after the time of hiring or prior to being appointed to work on Customer Data and annually recertified thereafter. Documentation of Security Awareness Training must be retained by Licensor, confirming that this training and subsequent annual recertification process have been completed, and available for review by Customer.

1.3 Customer will have the right to review Licensor’s information security program prior to the commencement of Customer’s entry of data into the Products or delivery to Customer of any Professional Services and from time to time during the Term of this Agreement. During the Term of the Agreement, from time to time with proper notice and Licensor approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld, Customer, at its own expense, will be entitled to perform, or to have performed, an on‐site audit of Licensor’s information security program and facilities. In lieu of an on‐site audit, upon request by Customer, Licensor will use reasonable efforts to complete, within forty‐five (45 days) of receipt, an Information Security Assessment questionnaire provided by Customer regarding Licensor’s information security program.

1.4 In the event of any actual or apparent theft, unauthorized use or disclosure of any Customer Data, Licensor will immediately commence all reasonable efforts to investigate and correct the causes and remediate the results thereof, and within two (2) business days following discovery of any such event, provide Customer notice thereof, and such further information and assistance as may be reasonably requested.

1.5 Customer Data, including but not limited to sales data, hosted, stored, or held by Licensor in the Product(s) or in the platform operated by Licensor, or on any device owned or in the custody of Licensor, its employees, agents or contractors, will be encrypted. Licensor will not transmit any unencrypted Customer Data over the internet or a wireless network, and will not store any Customer Data on any mobile computing device, such as a laptop computer, USB drive or portable data device, except where there is a business necessity and then only if the mobile computing device is protected by industry‐standard encryption software approved by Customer.

1.6 The parties acknowledge and agree that any disclosure of Customer Data will in no way be construed to be an assignment, transfer, or conveyance of title to or ownership rights in such Customer Data.

2. Network and Communications Security
2.1 All Licensor connectivity to Customer computing systems and all attempts at same will be only through Customer’s security gateways/firewalls and only through Customer‐approved security procedures.
2.2 Licensor will not access, and will not permit unauthorized persons or entities to access, Customer computing systems and/or networks without Customer’s express written authorization, and any such actual or attempted access will be consistent with any such authorization.
2.3 Licensor will take appropriate measures to ensure that Licensor’s systems connecting to Customer’s systems and anything provided to Customer through such systems do not contain any Disabling Device. For purposes of this Agreement, “Disabling Device” means any programs, mechanisms, programming devices, malware or other computer code (i) designed to disrupt, disable, harm, or otherwise impede in any manner the operation of any software program or code, or any computer system or network (commonly referred to as “malware”, “spyware”, “viruses” or “worms”); (ii) that would disable or impair the operation thereof or of any software, computer system or network in any way based on the elapsing of a period of time or the advancement to a particular date or other numeral (referred to as “time bombs”, “time locks”, or “drop dead” devices); (iii) is designed to or could reasonably be used to permit a party or any third party to access any computer system or network (referred to as “trojans”, “traps”, “access codes” or “trap door” devices); or (iv) is designed to or could reasonably be used to permit a party or any third party to track, monitor or otherwise report the operation and use of any software program or any computer system or network by the other party or any of its customers.

3. Customer Data Handling Procedures
Erasure of Information and Destruction of Electronic Storage Media. If Customer Data is required to be permanently deleted from any storage media owned or operated by Licensor, all electronic storage media containing Customer Data must be wiped or degaussed for physical destruction or disposal, in a manner meeting forensic industry standards such as the NIST SP800‐88 Guidelines for Media Sanitization. Licensor must maintain documented evidence of data erasure and destruction. This evidence must be available for review at the request of Customer.

4. Physical Security
All backup and archival media containing Customer Data must be contained in secure, environmentally‐controlled storage areas owned, operated, or contracted for by Licensor and all backup and archival media containing Customer Data must be encrypted.

5. Penetration Testing
Licensor will provide Customer with an annual, third party Penetration Test report. During the term of this Agreement, Licensor will engage, at its own expense and at least one time per year, a third party vendor reasonably acceptable to Customer to perform penetration and vulnerability testing (“Penetration Tests”) with respect to Licensor’s systems. The objective of such Penetration Tests is to identify design and/or functionality issues in infrastructure of Licensor’s systems that could expose Customer Data and its computer and network equipment and systems to risks from malicious activities. Penetration Tests will probe for weaknesses in network perimeters or other infrastructure elements as well as weaknesses in process or technical countermeasures relating to Licensor’s systems that could be exploited by a malicious party. Penetration Tests will identify, at a minimum, the following security vulnerabilities: invalidated or unsanitized input; broken access control; broken authentication and session management; cross‐site scripting (XSS) flaws; buffer overflows; injection flaws; improper error handling; insecure storage; denial of service; insecure configuration management; proper use of SSL/TLS; proper use of encryption; and anti‐virus reliability and testing. Within a reasonable period after the annual Penetration Test has been performed, Customer may request from Licensor a report of any high level and medium level security issues that were revealed during such Penetration Test and subsequent certification in writing to Customer that such high level and medium level security issues have been fully remediated. To the extent that high level and/or medium level security issues were revealed during a particular Penetration Test, Licensor will subsequently engage, at its own expense, the Testing Customer to perform an additional Penetration Test within a reasonable period thereafter to ensure continued resolution of identified security issues and will notify Customer with the results thereof.

 6. Background Checks
Licensor will perform background checks on all Licensor personnel and direct hire contractors including temporary and non‐employee personnel who will be performing services for Customer, including but not limited to implementation services under any Statement(s) of Work, that requires access to Customer Data pursuant to this Agreement. Licensor will not assign any employee to perform services for Customer who has not authorized a background investigation, or whose background investigation has revealed the conviction of a felony or misdemeanor within the previous seven (7) years, measured back from the time such Licensor employee commences services pursuant to the Agreement, to the extent such felony or misdemeanor relates to the suitability of the individual’s employment, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law. If Licensor contracts, for any services, with a third party that needs to be allowed or requires access to Customer Data, the third party will undergo the same Licensor background checks as performed on Licensor personnel and contractors under this section.

7. SSAE‐16/SOC‐1
Customer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement (together with any related agreements, including licenses and/or Statement(s) of Work) and receive a full refund for all monies prepaid thereunder in the event that Licensor fails to produce an acceptable SSAE‐16/ SOC‐1 Type II report.
[End of Exhibit Language] __________________________________________

Below is an example **Statement of Work** for an open source project that includes points around Open Source Quality Assurance (OSQA). 

**Overview**

Following the open-sourcing of Software, Vendor proposes to assist Client State to:

   - Monitor and improve deployability: Monitor and advise on Software's deployability by other jurisdictions; improve Software's deployability as needed.
  - Improve deployment process: Analyze, improve, and document Software's deployment process.
  - Manage third-party contributions: Help manage code contributions and other contributions from third-party contributors.
- Assist with public communications: Help inform governments and the civic technology community about Software's availability and capabilities.
 - Plan and advise on long-term maintenance: Help find or create an appropriate long-term home for the Software source code and related assets, to support long-term maintenance while also ensuring that State's needs with respect to Software continue to be met.  This involve forming or joining a consortium.
 - Develop open source contracting and procurement language: See description below.
 - Advise on open source / open technology processes: See description below.
 - Hackathons / Events: Organize and/or assist in organizing hackathons and other events to promote actionable interest in Software.

This proposed Statement of Work describes mainly ongoing processes. Although each process will likely have specific deliverables associated with it, not all of those deliverables can be predicted in advance. Therefore, this SOW proposes activities with time boundaries, not with the intention of ending the work when the time limit is reached, but to give State a scheduled checkpoint to assess the quality and direction of the work so far, with the option to extend and/or amend the contract if desired.

**Assistance Areas**

Monitor and improve deployability

Vendor will regularly monitor the deployability of the Software code and sample data, both by self-deployments and by maintaining regular contact with other parties attempting to deploy Software in real-world environments.  Where possible, Vendor will seek to improve Software's deployability. Maintaining easy deployability is crucial in Software's success, not only in jurisdictions outside State but, in the long run, even for State itself.  Ease of deployability ultimately means not only ease of adoption, but faster turnaround times on bug reports, greater flexibility in live deployment options, and expanded ability for others to participate in release testing.

It is typically somewhat difficult for a primary vendor who controls the live production environment to monitor generic deployability effectively. There are too many pressures on that vendor to focus all effort on deployability for the specific case of the primary client's data in that client's environment – even though in the long run, improved general deployability also results in improved deployability for the production environment too.  Vendor thus proposes to serve as an independent third party, ensuring that deployability standards are maintained.

Improve deployment process

Ease and standardization in Software's deployment process are crucial for Software adoption.  The first step for any other jurisdiction interested in Software is to stand up a test instance with their own data; without a reliable, well-documented data-import and deployment process, this first step will continue to be a major hurdle.

Vendor will perform technical analysis and make technical and documentation improvements as needed to ensure that deployment is manageable for a wide range of jurisdictions and vendors.

Manage third-party contributions

Many aspects of managing incoming open source contributions (core code, documentation, sample data, third-party deployment scripts, bug reports, etc) do not require deep technical expertise in the software.  Vendor proposes to handle, as an ongoing process, the parts of contribution management than can be separated from in-depth code review and technical decision-making.  State and Vendor would of course still make final decisions about what contributions to accept, and how, but Vendor would take care of the entry-level open source project management bureaucracy as much as possible, including but not necessarily limited to:

 - Day-to-day communications with participants in the project's open source forums;
 - First-pass review of contributions, to ensure proper formatting, description (log message), etc;
  - First-pass review of public bug reports, to have initial dialogue with the reporter, resolve duplicates, make sure proper reproduction recipes are included, answer common questions, spot trends in the user community, etc.
 - Monitoring of the public discussion forums, to make sure the right parties are talking to each other, to help gather a formal knowledge base (e.g., FAQ) about the software, and to flag important items for State and/or Vendor's attention
 - Management of Contributor License Agreements, to make sure the project can legally and safely accept the contribution;
 - Management of contributors in GitHub;
- Management of public-facing documentation, to the extent that deep technical knowledge of Software is not required (which we anticipate being a fairly broad extent);
 - Coordinate with Vendor on contributions that are being accepted into the core code for general release, to make sure that the internal development process is plugged into the public forums in ways the community can use.

We believe that this semi-separable part of contribution management is probably more than half of the typical public engagement overhead of running an open source project – speaking roughly, somewhere between 70% and 75% of that overhead.  Having Vendor handle this portion would allow Vendor to concentrate on technical review and on just the communications that directly involve core code or State-desired features, and maximize the project's ability to get the full advantage of public engagement, which, if done right, far outweighs the overhead.  Vendor would of course remain free to become as involved with public technical engagement as they wish to be & have the bandwidth to be, and Vendor would fully support them in this.

Assist with public communications

Running an open source project with a primary stakeholder of State's size inevitably involves moments when messaging (about the inclusion or exclusion of a core feature, for example) must be done in a careful and well-considered manner, in ways that will be comprehensible by both the open source and civic technology communities – including government officials and other vendors.

There are more and less successful ways to send such messages.  The more successful ones leave all stakeholders feeling confident about the project and its future (even if their particular concern or bug was not addressed, or even was exacerbated).  The less successful ones leave some stakeholders feeling uncertain, and possibly reconsidering their involvement or their adoption of the software.  Vendor proposes to assist with such public communications, taking an advisory role in both drafting and reviewing them, in helping to determine which forums and media to broadcast such messages in, and in managing responses to incoming communications.

Plan and advise on long-term maintenance

The Software's long-term maintenance may involve participation by multiple cities and vendors.  Vendor proposes to help State determine the best shape for this long-term maintenance structure and, depending on the outcome of that process, help to set it up.  This will involve discussions with State as well as with with vendors such as [...], open technology consortia and organizations such as [...], and others.

Vendor will provide both structural advice, negotiation help, and, if necessary, legal assistance in setting up or joining such a body, in such a way as to ensure that State's interests are protected along with the long-term health of the Software code.  We emphasize that the success of any such consortium-based maintenance plan depends much more on the technical success and adoption of Software itself than on the particular arrangement of the consortium: no shared maintenance effort can succeed if the software itself is not successful, while even a flawed shared maintenance arrangement can still succeed quite well if the software is fundamentally healthy and in demand.

Develop open source contracting and procurement language

Vendor will work with State to collect and analyze (from an open source development perspective) the State's experiences in the Software's procurement and development contract, and suggest language or process improvements that could help build open source practices into Software and future software projects from the start, in a way compatible with State's existing procurement procedures.

Advise on open source / open technology processes

During the phase leading up to the open sourcing, we discovered that various unforeseen questions related to open source processes and technology tend to arise.  Their exact topics and timing at least cannot be reliably predicted (for example, in the couple of weeks immediately prior to this draft SOW, we discussed open source databases and deployment procedures in some depth, security audit contracting & timing, and other things).  However, statistically, the overall rate and complexity of the questions is somewhat predictable, so we propose to simply budget for it explicitly in phase two.

Hackathons / Events

Vendor will assist State in determining what developer-oriented events (such as hackathons) would be most effective in promoting Software usage and adoption, and as appropriate organize or assist in organizing those events, including promotion, management of the event itself, and post-event results processing.

The current Statement of Work calls for one hackathon, in Fiscal Year 2019, covering both Software core development and API development.  It is possible that two hackathons (perhaps one focusing just on API usage, and another on both core and API) would be a good investment, and/or that events other than hackathons could benefit Software, but in any case we would still recommend that they happen in FY 2019.  Such events do better the more potential attendees there are already familiar with the technology in question and the longer that technology has been publicly available and discussed.  In both respects, Software will be in a better position for such events in FY 2019 than in FY 2018.
