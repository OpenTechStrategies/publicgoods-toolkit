# Interview with Kari Moe - NORAD 
**** Role of NORAD, United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and its Chief Digital Office.
     Funding DPGs.

     Have supported DPGs for a number of years, dating back to 1990s
     w/ DHIS2.  Coherent thinking is more recent, though, dating back
     to about 2014/2015, when started working in education sector w/
     Open Learning Resources -- had open competition on that.

     Started supporting new partnerships around DPGs.

     List of DPGs keeps growing.

     DHIS2 is one of the larger ones

     Mostly funding, not implementing.

     UNICEF, UN Tech Envoy's office.
**** Where does funding go?
     NORAD supports core activities of the larger DPGs.
     Not involved in contracting decisions.

     Have not prioritized guidelines on open source
**** Who is the toolkit's audience?  she asks
     in-country offices, leaf nodes basically
     it's for non-hostile audiences
**** Particular projects
***** DHIS2
      In 70 countries!  Very widely used.
      Get DHIS2 primer from DPGA web site.
      Model is based on academic collaboration;
      "very interesting model", and they wonder
      if it could be a model for DPG collaborations
      in general.

      key is collab btw ministries and academic institutions.  impl is
      driven by ministries, core dpg is developed and maintained by
      the university.  She thinks it's fairly unique.

      She'll put us in touch with the team.

***** MOSIP
      Modular Open Source Identity Platform
      team in India.  Grew out of Adhaar
      open source but inspired by Adhaar.

      Very new -- established in 2018
      pilots in Morocco and Philippines, and others in pipeline
      lots of interest grew during covid pandemic
      receiving a lot more interest now

      Implemented w/ World Bank's "ID4D" program

      Also a university team, supporting directly
      the countries that do support it, but limited
      capacity -- couldn't do 100 countries with
      this model.  Not exactly the same as how DHIS2
      works.

      For digital public infrastructure, thought of not relying on
      commercial interests, and of maybe staying within academic
      world
***** NORAD keeps discovering new DPGs
      e.g., main weather forecasting model used by meteorological inst
      there, used around the world, and happens to be openly licensed.
      So plenty of DPGs just happen.
***** OpenLMIS
      Just knows it by name, doesn't know much about it.
***** Global Digital Library
      NORAD led the development of this one themselves.
      flagship project in education sector

      Today managed from NORAD, which is tricky, b/c not supposed to
      impl just to fund, but they are impl and managing it now.

      It's going quite well.  May evolve over the next year.

      Example of cross-gov replication.
**** How does NORAD make decisions / receive proposals / etc?
     She is in the "Innovation Unit", small unit that initially grew
     out of education sector, so initially a lot of projects were ed
     related.  In 2014/2015 when started was driven a lot by personal
     initiative.  She came in in 2016, but still small team of two
     people.  Still very much driven by interest/passion/opportunity.
     But now expanding a bit and formalizing, so future is likely to
     be more methodological.

     Norwegian priorites push, e.g., MOSIP matched priorities around
     COVID.

     Their unit has to convice the other thematic units that something
     is worth funding.
**** Who asks NORAD for help, and if so, what do they ask for?
     Most funding is through open calls in certain areas.

     Some dedicated funding through inst collab btw universities

     Most Norwegian aid goes through multilateral agencies.  But
     innovation unit is operating a bit differently from that.

     Budget is growing; generally this program is seen as successful.
     See themselves as leveraging other funders.
**** Who are those other funders?
     Philanthropic donors, "bilateral donors",

     Tendency for funders to want to plant their flag on successes,
     which discourages other funders.  But openness of DPGs promotes
     collaboration, or rather expands the area available on which to
     plant flags; e.g., you could fund DHIS2 in a new country -- and
     part of what you get to say is that you were "collaborative" :-).

     NORAD is encouraging other Norwegian gov agencies to use/make
     open source, and they are receptive.  It's not NORAD's main
     responsibilty, but they do get asked for advice on that.

     In partners (like NGOs, or partners NORAD is funding operations
     at), "DPGs" is becoming a bit of a budget.  But NORAD has very
     limited capacity to give support.  There's a lot of demand for
     understanding how NGOs can develop and use DPGs.

     NORAD has a few people to point to for licensing advice, but
     there isn't really a go-to place for DPGs in general.  The DPGA
     is not that -- secretariat is too small to be that.  Right now
     all it can do is screen to verify that something is a DPG, but
     "the capacity to provide sustantive input and feedback is going
     to be fairly limited".

     Have thought about hiring consultants who could be on call for
     that; been exploring that option.  Having written materials only
     goes so far.
