# **References** 

(TBD: UNICEF reports are pdf and have references at end I wasn't
entirely sure how to handle citations for a paper that, I believe,
will only be published on the web, so I followed a modified MLA. Only
included referenced blogs, journal articles, and reports in works
cited -- things from which I pulled direct and indirect insights. I
did not include additional listing of just a web site that's already
linked in a module unless there was significant information from that
site referenced. There are some judgment calls in this approach. For
example, I didn't include citations for the main web site for a DPG,
or to its GitHub repo (but these are linked to in the text), or to the
Ghana's cybersecurity law.

No in-text citatations either b/c we have hyperlinks.)
